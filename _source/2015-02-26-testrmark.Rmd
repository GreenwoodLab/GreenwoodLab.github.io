This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r lmfit, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
summary(fit<-lm(speed~dist, cars))
```

```{r lmplot}
plot(fit)   
```

$$ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1-\alpha \beta \gamma) $$
