title: Statistical Genetics at the Lady Davis Institute
---

[Celia Greenwood](http://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/people) is interested in statistical methods for the analysis of genetic and genomic data. Recently, her [group](http://www.mcgill.ca/statisticalgenetics/people/students-and-associates) has been focusing on ways of characterizing tumour abnormalities, analysis methods for rare genetic variants such as those identified by sequencing studies, and analysis of DNA methylation data.

She is an integral part of the Genetic Epidemiology group at the [Lady Davis Institute](http://www.ladydavis.ca/) and the [Segal Cancer Centre](http://www.jgh.ca/en/SegalCancerCentre) where she is supported by the [Weekend to End Women's Cancers](http://www.endcancer.ca/index.html).  She is also a Director of the recently formed [Ludmer Centre for Neuroinformatics and Mental Health](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/news/1220?locale=en), which is developing and implementing methods for integrating behavioural phenotypes, epigenetic, genetic and brain imaging data.
