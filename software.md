## [pcev](https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/pcev)

> [pcev](https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/pcev) is an [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package which implements Principal components of explained variance (PCEV).

It is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal components Analysis (PCA), which seeks the maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates.
