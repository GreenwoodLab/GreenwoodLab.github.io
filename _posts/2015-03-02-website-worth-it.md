A website is a good way to

  * keep track of what's being discussed at lab meetings
  * flawless integration with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and free hosting via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  * Everyone can contribute to the website with **NO** knowledge of `HTML`
  * This is faciliated by markup languages: [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/) 
  * Only limited knowledge of [GitHub](https://github.com/) is necessary
  * have a greater Net presence
  * Blog about experiences, R tips using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  * Share commonly used functions via [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
